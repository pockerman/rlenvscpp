# rlenvscpp

```rlenvscpp``` is an effort to provide implementations and wrappers of environments suitable for training reinforcement learning agents
using  C++. In addition, the library provides various utilities such as experiment tracking,
representing trajectories  via waypoints and simple implementation of popular dynamics such as 
quadrotor dynamics.

Various RL algorithms using the environments can be found at <a href="https://github.com/pockerman/cuberl/tree/master">cuberl</a>.

The documentation for the library can be found <a href="https://rlenvscpp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">here</a>
